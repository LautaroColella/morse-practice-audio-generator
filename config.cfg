# Configuration file
#
# Available levels: "beginner", "intermediate", "advanced", "arbitrary"
# The value represents the times a silent dot sound is played (dot_sound_length * value = delay in milliseconds)
# "delay_between_sounds" is the delay between "dot and dot", "dot and dash", "dash and dash"
#
# ===== Specific level values =====
# beginner
# * delay_between_sounds = 3
# * delay_between_characters = 5
# * delay_between_words = 9
#
# intermediate (Farnsworth Timing)
# * delay_between_sounds = 1
# * delay_between_characters = 5
# * delay_between_words = 9
#
# advanced (Standard Timing)
# * delay_between_sounds = 1
# * delay_between_characters = 3
# * delay_between_words = 7

#
# Lower bitrates will result in smaller file sizes but may degrade audio quality
# Supported values are: "32k", "64k", "96k", "128k", "192k", "256k", "320k"
